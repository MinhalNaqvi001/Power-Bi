# Power-Bi
Power bi Project
In this project, I conducted a comprehensive sales performance analysis, tracking and visualizing sales trends over time (monthly, quarterly, and yearly). I analyzed sales performance across products, countries, and market segments, identifying top-performing products and regions.

To gain deeper insights, I assessed profit margins using a treemap to compare profitability across different products and regions. I also compared profits against COGS with a stacked column chart to evaluate cost efficiency. Additionally, I identified the most lucrative market segments using a clustered column chart and analyzed which products contribute the most to revenue and profits using a line and clustered column chart.
